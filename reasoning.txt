MSK:
 - There will be NO global or static variables.

 - msk_*_create() will now have to call a msk_module_create(..., ..., ...)
instead of filling named fields in a structure. It's less readable, but it

 - msk_*_process() will have to rely on its state for storing port buffer locations. Any new model will have to satisfy: speed, readability.
