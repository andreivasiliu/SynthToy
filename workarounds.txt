This is a list of lazy coding workarounds that MUST be rewritten:

 - buffer aquisition at runtime
 - output buffer initialization
 - the instrument implementation is crude... iron it out
 - the MIDI modules need to find a better way to get their instrument
 - the oscillator interpolation was broken by an 'upgrade'.
 - melded ports cause trouble.
